Up to v0.30 JS/CC uses the $ symbol as a special terminal symbol to mark the EOF.

The $ symbol is used by JessieCode as a special method and therefore is part of the Identifier regex pattern and might
be used in JessieCode source. Hence, if someone wants to update JS/CC, please make sure to patch jscc.js:

Try to find the piece of code, where the $ terminal symbol is created (line 1791 in v0.30)

	//Create EOF symbol
	item = create_item( 0 );
	s = create_symbol( "$", SYM_TERM, SPECIAL_EOF );
	item.lookahead.push( s );

and change it to something else, e.g. $$$:

	//Create EOF symbol
	item = create_item( 0 );
	s = create_symbol( "$$$", SYM_TERM, SPECIAL_EOF );
	item.lookahead.push( s );
